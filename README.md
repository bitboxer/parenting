# Parenting

One of the best pieces of advice I got for parenting was this:

> Never listen to parenting advice by people with only
> one kid.

So be warned. This is my first kid :wink: .

Here you will find some lists with things I learned along the way.

* [How to prepare for a baby](https://bitboxer.de/2018/01/11/how-to-prepare-for-a-baby/)
* the list of things in our [hospital bag](hospital_bag.md)
* [basic equipment](basic_equipment.md) you might need for your baby

More documents can be found [here](https://github.com/dadaberlin/parenting).

I started a slack group for fathers* in tech here in Berlin. If you
